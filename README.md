**This library is provided as-is and is not under active development**

Android 4.0 CalendarView backported to 2.2
Probably has to be built against API level 15  
  
To use this library, it's required that the 1 attribute is added to your theme. Check library/res/values/themes.xml on how to do this.

**FORK:**
Add 2 methods for highlighting dates on the calendar, as well as next and previous arrows to the month name. Theme has been changed to light so the highlighting is easier to see. Look at the code below setContentView in the sample activity for a commented usage guide.
